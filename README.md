# Titanic Survival Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts passenger survival on the Titanic using real historical data. This project includes data exploration, feature engineering, and model building using a complete Scikit-learn pipeline with hyperparameter tuning via cross-validation.

## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to use structured data to train a classification model that predicts whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster. In addition to building a predictive model, this project extracts meaningful insights from the data, reflecting real-world patterns such as age, gender, and social class.
